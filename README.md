## How model submission works. 
_Note: Workflows are currently in development!_

Submit a model: 
* open a new issue using the [New model request](https://github.com/ModelAtlasofTheEarth/Model_Submission/issues/new/choose)

Request a review:
* by adding a https://github.com/ModelAtlasofTheEarth/Model_Submission/labels/review%20requested label to the issue

Model repository creation
* The [model_reviewers`](https://github.com/orgs/ModelAtlasofTheEarth/teams/model_reviewers) team will add an https://github.com/ModelAtlasofTheEarth/Model_Submission/labels/approved label to the issue
* this trigger the creation of a repository for your model based in this template

Upload model to NCI Server (National Comoutational Infrastructure) 
* Add an https://github.com/ModelAtlasofTheEarth/Model_Submission/labels/upload%20to%20NCI label to the model submission issue
* The [model_reviewers`](https://github.com/orgs/ModelAtlasofTheEarth/teams/model_reviewers) team will contact you via email to provide accesss to out server
* This will allow the large file payload to be added to you model
